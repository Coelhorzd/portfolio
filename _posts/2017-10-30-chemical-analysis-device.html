<h4>Context</h4>

          <p class="p1">  As a chemist I have noticed how difficult is to get used to scientific research softwares. HPLC is one of the most used chemical analysis device around the world so I aim to find a way to make it more intuitive thus easier to learn and faster to use (specially for new users).  </p>


<p class="p2"> Design Thinking was the chosen approach.</p>


<h4>Empathizing</h4>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1"> For the research I talked to a former professor I had when I studied at university and he introduced me to some of his master and doctorate degree students so I could interview him and those post-graduate students. I also observed them using the software while they were doig their research. </p>

<p> There were 4 on this stage. </p>
