<h4>Context</h4>

          <p class="p1">  As a chemist I have noticed how difficult is to get used to research scientific softwares. HPLC is one of the most used chemical analysis device used around the world so I aim to find a way to make it more intuitive thus easier to learn and use (specially for new users).  </p>
<p> A secondary goal was to exercise my design skills and I did this project alone. </p>

<p class="p2"> Design Thinking was the chosen approach.</p>


<h4>Empathizing</h4>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1"> The interest of working on this project was first triggered by observing people in lines at banks, so first stage of research was about observation and informal talks with realtives and friends.
After that a survey was created and shared with some coworkers and friends. </p>

<p> There were 7 on this stage. </p>
