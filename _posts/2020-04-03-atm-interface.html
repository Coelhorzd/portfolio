<h3>Overview</h3>

<p class="p1">
<h5> The challenge </h5>
</p>

<p>  This UX design exercise was chosen after I observed people in a queue waiting to use an ATM machine. </p>
<p> Most used ATMs in Brazil are in the banks, but even that nowadays many people use their bank app we still have
to use the ATM for some tasks. So it's a great opportunity for a project trying to improve ATM users experience. </p>
<p class="p2"> This study case happens in Brazil so perhaps some points may only make sense for user experience at the ATM
  machines of brazilian banks. </p>

  <h5> Length of project </h5>
  <p class="p2">  I did this project alone in my freetime and it took me around 3 months. </p>

  <h5>Process</h5>

<p class="p2"> Double diamond method was used on this project development.</p>

<h3>Discovering</h3>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1">On the first stage of research I interviewed some coworkers and relatives.
After that a survey was created to be shared and test some assumptions, and also to understand better the current state. </p>

<p> There were 6 participants on this stage. </p>

<h3>Defining</h3>
<p> (pain points, problems) </p>

<p class="p1">  The survey showed that <b>to withdraw and make a deposit are the most often performed tasks on the ATMs</b>. Yet,
   few users also transfer money, deal with loans details and get the validation to use bank app on their smartphones. But they 
   would like to do <b>everything on the app</b>, if possible. Withdraw and make a deposit are impossible tasks to do on the app</p>

  <p> Some users would like to be able to <b>update personal information</b> which on the app aswell which, for while, is done only
     if you go inside the bank to talk to someone. </p>

  <p class="p2"> But the most interesting point I have noticed is: To accomplish what you want when you go to the ATM, <b>everyone
    still loses a lot of time</b>. People lose time waiting on the line, people wait for the machine to recongnize their card, they
    wait for the machine to verify their password or biometrics, and they wait for the machine to deliver the money. </p>
