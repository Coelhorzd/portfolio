<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>

<h5> The challenge </h5>

<p>  Photography cameras have had a very similar design for over a century, even after they became digital (DSLR and
   more recently mirrorless) they still have similar look and controls . </p>
<p> As an amateur photographer I’ve felt how difficult is to learn how to use a camera properly because it
has a lot of buttons and features. Most recents Fujifilm's cameras have a better experience that is why I chosed
this maker to apply this redesign project.</p>

<br>

<h5> My role and length of project </h5>
<p> I have done this redesign exercise on my own and it took me about 4 months. </p>

<br>

<h2>Discovering</h2>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1">I talked to few photographers and I found a very userful video (where two photographers
  were questioning current cameras designs) then I created a survey based on notes about the video and
  notes from the chats with photographers.</p>

  <br>

      </p>
  </div>

  <p class="p2">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> Fstoppers Youtube channel - video about cameras design</span>
  </p>

  <br>

  <p> The main assumptions (from the video and talks) that were covered on the survey: </p>

  <p class="p1"> 1 - Quicker and more intuitive way to change Aperture, ISO and shutter speed; </p>
  <p> 2 - Modes A, S, M aren’t most adequate;</p>
  <p> 3 - Dedicated White balance and Tint control with easier access;</p>
  <p> 4 - Shoot modes (single shot, burst), maybe a pressure sensor to change FPS while shooting;</p>
  <p> 5 - More efficient way to move the focus point on screen;</p>
  <p> 6 - More efficient way to zoom in and out and move around when reviewing a photo;</p>
  <p> 7 - Being able to save settings for photo or video and alternate between them quickly;</p>
  <p> 8 - When using a mirrorless camera's viewfinder, be able to choose whether a scene is shown regard or regardless
    exposure;</p>
  <p> 9 - All (or most) buttons and adjusts accessible for the right hand;</p>
  <p> 10 - Screen - better quality, bigger and more responsible touch screen; </p>
  <p> 11 - Battery door on the side and not on the bottom;</p>
  <p> 12 - Better strap conection and easy lock/unlock system to easy changes;</p>
  <p> 13 - Proper eyepiece locking system, to prevent losing it;</p>
<p class="p2">  14 - Improving camera ergonomics (weight, size, shape);</p>

<h2>Defining</h2>

 <p> An affinity map was created with the answers gathered from the survey.</p>

 </p>

<br>

<p> As those points reach <b>many different aspects</b> of the camera and its use, and <b>not all</b> interviewed
  photographers are <b>Fujifilm users</b>, it was necessary to <b>prioritize</b> <small>(see more on the bottom section
    "my learnings")</small> to define the design problems with a <b>practical approach.</b></p>
  <br>

  <div class="highlights">
            <br>

            <h6> Design problems </h6>

  <p class="p1">1 - Lack of viewfinder customization: Be able to choose which information you want to see, be able to
    make modes changes (see that information on viewfinder) and be able to choose seeing a scene regard/regardless
    exposition; </p>

  <p class="p1">2 - Touch screen: If always sensitive it creates a problem about accidental touches. Even it's a
    powerful tool, it hasn't been widely used;</p>

  <p class="p1">3 - Settings: In some cases photographers need changing back and forth between different light conditions
     or between photo and video so they need a way to save and quickly access sets of settings;</p>

  <p class="p1">4 - A, S, M - Modes: Is this the best approach for users?;</p>

  <p class="p1">5 - Buttons/dials: Some are used a lot, others not so much. Usually there are no flexibility about what
    a certain button/dial does and users crave for customization;</p>

  <p class="p1">6 - Zoom in/out and moving the focuss point aren't so practical.</p>

<h5> My learnings</h5>

<p class="p1"> After I had talked to phootgraphers, done the survey and got the answers back I was advised by a mentor
   that I was going too broad on project's scope that I was more on a conceptual design path than UX design. I had
   to prioritize and remember that UX is as much about <b>technical possibilities</b> and <b>bussiness needs</b> as the
   user's needs.</p>
<p> So I narrowed down to the camera maker which is doing a better User Centered Design work (the one which
     have been working on most of the problems I've found on my research). I also filtered the answers towards what
     problems Fujifilm could improve on their models.</p>
<p> As a personal learning I realized that it is kind of easy for me to diverge and have new ideas but I gotta pay
     attention on the convergent stages because they are so important as having ideas. </p>

   What I’ve found?

  Ideation notes

     # ISO, Aperture, SS (shutter speed) adjustment possibilities:

1- Squared touch pad with 3 zones on the left to pick one of them, slide to the right area where the adjustment is made.
 Up/down increase/decrease value;
2- Squared touch pad. Up/down just to adjust because the picking is still using dedicated buttons;
3- Squared touch pad to pick one or them but adjusting is made with a dial;
3 independent dials;


     #  White balance and tint adjustment:

First picking on touch screen, further adjustments are made by dedicated button + dial;
First picking on touch screen, further adjustments are made by dedicated button + touch bar;

     # Manual focus adjustment:

Dedicated button + activates manual focuss on touch screen; (Or touch bar)
Shutter button + activates manual focuss on touch screen; (Or touch bar)

     # Focus point adjustment (looking through viewfinder):

Dedicated button + touch pad;
Shutter button + touch pad;
