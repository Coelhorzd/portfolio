<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>

<h5> The challenge </h5>

<p>  Photographic cameras have always had a very similar design, even after they became digital (DSLR and more recently
   mirrorless) they still have similar looks and controls . </p>
<p> As an amateur photographer I’ve felt how difficult is to learn how to use a camera properly because it
has a lot of buttons and features. Most recent Fujifilm's cameras have an interesting experience that is why I chosed
this maker as a starting point.</p>

<br>

<h5> My role and length of project </h5>
<p class="p2"> I have done this redesign exercise on my own and it took me about 4 months. </p>


  <h5>Process</h5>

<p class="p2"> Double diamond method was used on this project development.</p>

<br>

<h2>Discovering</h2>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1">I talked to few photographers and I found a very userful video (where two photographers
  were questioning current cameras designs) then I created a survey based on my notes about the video and my
  notes from the chats with photographers.</p>

  <br>

  </div>

  <p class="p2">

  </p>

  <br>

  <p> The main points presented on the survey were: </p>

  <p class="p1"> 1 - Quicker and more intuitive way to change Aperture, ISO and shutter speed; </p>
  <p> 2 - Modes A, S, M aren’t most adequate. Let’s say you want to adjust Aperture and ISO, or shutter speed and aperture but
    you do not want a full manual mode;</p>
  <p> 3 - Dedicated White balance and Tint control with fast access;</p>
  <p> 4 - Shoot modes (single shot, burst), maybe a pressure sensor to change FPS while shooting;</p>
  <p> 5 - Easier and quicker way to move the focus point on screen;</p>
  <p> 6 - Easier an quicker way to zoom in and out on preview mode;</p>
  <p> 7 - Being able to save settings for photo or video and alternate between them quickly;</p>
  <p> 8 - When looking through the viewfinder (on mirrorless cameras), you should be able to see how the picture is exposed or
    without taking it into account;</p>
  <p> 9 - All (or most) buttons and adjusts accessible for the right hand, leaving the left hand with only one job (hold the
    camera);</p>
  <p> 10 -Screen - better quality, bigger and more responsible touch screen; </p>
  <p> 11 - Battery door on the side and not on the bottom;</p>
  <p> 12 - Better strap conection and easy lock/unlock system so you can exchange them easily and fast;</p>
  <p> 13 - Proper eyepiece locking system, to prevent losing it;</p>
<p class="p2">  14 - Improving camera ergonomics;</p>

<br>

<h6> 7 photographers answered the survey.</h6>

<h2>Defining</h2>

 <p> An affinity map was created with the answers gathered from the survey.</p>

 </div>

 </p>

<br>

<p> As those points reach <b>many different aspects</b> of the camera and its use, and the users who answered the survey
  <b>aren't exclusive fujifilm users</b>, it was necessary to <b>prioritize</b> <small>(see more on the bottom section
    "my learnings")</small> to make it possible to define the design problems with a <b>practical approach.</b></p>
  <br>

  <div class="highlights">
            <br>

            <h6> Design problems </h6>

  <p class="p1">1 - Lack of viewfinder customization: Be able to choose which information you want to see, be able to
    make modes changes (see that information on viewfinder) and be able to choose seeing a scene regard
    exposition/regardless exposition; </p>

  <p class="p1">2 - Touch screen: If always sensitive it creates a problem about accidental touches and yet it's a
    powerful tool which has not been widely used;</p>

  <p class="p1">3 - Settings: In some cases photographers need changing back and forth between different light conditions
     or between photo and video so they need a way to save and quickly access sets of settings;</p>

  <p class="p1">4 - Buttons/dials: Some are used a lot, others not so much but they are there to confuse new users or just
     ruins the camera's look. Usually there are no flexibility about what a certain button/dial does and users crave for
     customization;</p>

  <p class="p1">5 - Zoom in/out and moving the focuss point aren't so practical.</p>

    <br>

  <h6> NOTE: There are points related to some problems on the list that were solved in the newest fujifilm
    mirrorless models, but as those problems emerged from the research I should at least metion them before I prioritize. </h6>

<h5> My learnings</h5>

<p class="p1"> At some point I've noticed that I was going too broad on project's scope that I was more on a conceptual industrial
   design path than UX design. I had to prioritize and remember that UX is as much about <b>technical possibilities</b> and <b>bussiness
     needs</b> as the user's needs.</p>
   <p> So I've realized that it is kind of easy for me to diverge and have new ideas but I gotta pay attention on the convergent
     stages because they are so important as having ideas. </p>

   What I’ve found?

  Ideation notes

ISO, Aperture, SS (shutter speed) adjustment possibilities:

Squared touch pad with 3 zones on the left to pick one of them, slide to the right area where the adjustment is made. Up/down increase/decrease value;
Squared touch pad. Up/down just to adjust because the picking is still using dedicated buttons;
Squared touch pad to pick one or them but adjusting is made with a dial;
3 independent dials;
Current design (button + dial);

White balance and tint adjustment:

First picking on touch screen, further adjustments are made by dedicated button + dial;
First picking on touch screen, further adjustments are made by dedicated button + touch bar;

Manual focus adjustment:

Ring on the lens + dedicated button to lock;
Dedicated touch bar( on top, close to shutter button) (possibly mechanical adjustment on the ring if lens motor does not work) + button (maybe on the lens) to lock;
Dedicated dial + button(maybe on the lens) to lock;
Shutter button + ring;
Shutter button + touch bar;
Shutter button + dial;

Focus point adjustment (looking through viewfinder):

Dedicated button + touch pad;
Shutter button + touch pad;
