<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>

<h5> The challenge </h5>

<p>  Photography cameras have had a very similar design for over a century, even after they became digital (DSLR and
   more recently mirrorless) they still have similar look and controls . </p>
<p> As an amateur photographer I’ve felt how difficult is to learn how to use a camera properly because it
has a lot of buttons and features. Most recents Fujifilm's cameras have a better overall experience than other makers,
that is why I chosed this brand as a starting point for this redesign project.</p>

<br>

<h5> My role and length of project </h5>
<p> I have done this redesign exercise on my own and it took me about 4 months. </p>

<br>

<h2>Discovering</h2>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1">I talked to few photographers and I found a very userful video (where two photographers
  were questioning current cameras designs) then I created a survey based on the video and chats notes.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="p2">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> Fstoppers Youtube channel - video about cameras design</span>
  </p>

  <br>

  <p> The main assumptions that were covered on the survey: </p>

  <p class="p1"> 1 - Quicker and more intuitive way to change Aperture, ISO and shutter speed; </p>
  <p> 2 - Modes A, S, M aren’t most adequate;</p>
  <p> 3 - Dedicated White balance and Tint control with easier access;</p>
  <p> 4 - Shoot modes (single shot, continuous), maybe a pressure sensor to change FPS while shooting;</p>
  <p> 5 - More efficient way to move the focus point on screen;</p>
  <p> 6 - More efficient way to zoom in and out and move around when reviewing a photo;</p>
  <p> 7 - Being able to save settings for photo or video and alternate between them quickly;</p>
  <p> 8 - When using a mirrorless camera's viewfinder, be able to choose whether a scene is shown regard or regardless
    exposure;</p>
  <p> 9 - All (or most) buttons and adjustments on the right hand;</p>
  <p> 10 - Screen - better quality, bigger and more responsible touch screen; </p>
  <p> 11 - Battery door on the side and not on the bottom;</p>
  <p> 12 - Better strap conection and easy lock/unlock system to easy changes;</p>
  <p> 13 - Proper eyepiece locking system, to prevent losing it;</p>
<p class="p2">  14 - Improving camera ergonomics (weight, size, shape);</p>

<h2>Defining</h2>

 <p> An affinity map was created with the answers gathered from the survey.</p>

<br>

<p> As those points reach <b>many different aspects</b> of the camera and its use, and <b>not all</b> interviewed
  photographers are <b>Fujifilm users</b>, it was necessary to <b>prioritize</b> <small>(see section
    "my learnings")</small> to define the design problems with a <b>practical approach.</b></p>
  <br>

  <div class="highlights">
            <br>

            <h6> Design problems </h6>

  <p class="p1">1 - Lack of viewfinder customization: Be able to choose which information you want to see, be able to
    change modes (and see on viewfinder) and be able to see a scene regard/regardless
    exposition; </p>

  <p class="p1">2 - Touch screen: If always sensitive accidental touches may happen. Touch screen is a
    powerful tool, which people are used to interact with, but it hasn't been widely used on cameras;</p>

  <p class="p1">3 - Settings: In some cases photographers need changing back and forth between different light conditions
     or between photo and video so they need a way to save and quickly access sets of settings;</p>

  <p class="p1">4 - A, S, M - Modes: Is this the best approach for users to have control of the camera?;</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/drive-dial.jpg" alt="">
      </p>
  </div>
<br>

  <p class="p1">5 - Buttons/dials: Some are used a lot, others not so much. Usually there are no flexibility about what
    a certain button/dial does and users crave for customization;</p>

  <p class="p1">6 - Zoom in/out (when checking a photo) and moving the focuss point aren't so practical using buttons, specially
    when looking through the viewfinder.</p>

  <p class="p1">7 - Ergonomics: the "box" shape is not confortable, the usual grip builds stress on wrist and
    fingers. Although it was observed that cameras with unusual shapes were not well received by users.</p>

<h2> Ideation </h2>
<br>
<h5>Solutions out there</h5>

<p class="p1"> Fujifilm, as de best experience on the market has already solved some of the problems found on the
  research. </p>

<p> Although they had made some advances on those problems there is space for other solutions. Aswell points 6 and 7 need
  some attention.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5> Proposed Solutions </h5>
<br>
<div class="highlights">
          <br>

<p> <b>Insight:</b>   </p>
<p> HOW MIGHT WE give to users a simpler and easier way to adjust Aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc (easy
  for any level of users)? </p>

<p class="p1"> <b>Solution:</b>   </p>
<p> - Replacing the dials + buttons (used to set Aperture, shutter speed and ISO) for a square touch pad
   which concentrate those 3 basic adjustments in one place and reduces the cognitive load. This touch pad works on
   touch-drag gestures for picking and adjusting each setting and a double tap locks individually each feature on auto
   mode.</p>

   <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto" ALIGN=CENTER>
       <p class="p1">
           <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/touchpad.png" alt="">
       </p>
   </div>
   <p class="p1">This is part of the solution for points 4 and 5.</p>



<p class="p1"> <b>Insight:</b>   </p>
<p>HOW MIGHT WE give to users more freedom on custom settings, buttons/dials and viewfinder? </p>

<p class="p1"> <b>Solution:</b>   </p>
<p> Giving <b>status visibility on viewfinder</b> of all the changes proposed in this case study and using touch screen, touchpad
  and touch bar along with fewer buttons, can make it more flexible. For example:</p>

<p> 1 - Moving the drive dial to the screen gives to users room to create more custom modes than a drive dial can have. Also
  moving the focuss mode to the screen allows the users to make those changes without taking the eye of the viewfinder.</p>
  <p> Touch and drag from the upper right corner of screen (drag down for drive dial and drag left for focuss modes). </p>

   <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto" ALIGN=CENTER>
       <p class="p1">
           <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/drive-touch.png" alt="">
       </p> </div>

<p class="p1"> 2 - If manual focuss mode is set, the right edge of the touch screen stays active. Up/down swipe moves the focuss
  further/closer. </p>

  <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto" ALIGN=CENTER>
      <p class="p1">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/manual-focuss.png" alt="">
      </p> </div>

<p class="p1"> 3 - To move the focuss point over the scene (on auto focuss mode): During half press use the touchpad. </p>
<p> 4 - To check a picture on viewfinder: Press the playback button, zoom in/out using the top touchbar and navigate
  using the touchpad. To check on screen you can also swipe top-down.</p>
  <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto" ALIGN=CENTER>
      <p class="p1">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/photo-zoom-nav.png" alt="">
      </p> </div>
         <p class="p1">This is part of the solution for points 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.</p>

<p class="p1"> <b>Insight:</b>   </p>
<p>HOW MIGHT WE prevent accidental touches? </p>
<p class="p1"> <b>Solution:</b>   </p>
<p> Using the viewfinder proximity sensor to lock the touch (except the right edge for the case above). Also by
  making the cameras a bit bigger (according to users, Fujifilm cameras are small). Most users desire a lighter camera but not
  necessarily smaller. </p>
  <p> Bigger cameras would also support bigger screens. </p>

<p class="p1"> <b>Insight:</b>   </p>
<p>HOW MIGHT WE improve cameras ergonomics? </p>
<p class="p1"> <b>Solution:</b>   </p>
<p> Lighter, not smaller cameras with a grip that keeps the wrist straight, which can be part of the camera's body or one that can
   be attatched like it happens with Fujifilm cameras. Also by making the front bottom corner (which rests on the left hand) rounded
   which would improve its confort.  </p>

<br>
</div>
<br>
<p> <b>#</b>   Just to mention, all the buttons, touchpad, touchbar and touch screen <b>can be customized</b>. Users can
  choose which modes are visible on their drive menu, they can chose the main use for the touchbar (which as standard is exposure
  compensation and changing white balance - when used with WB button), etc.   <b>#</b>  </p>

<h2> Testing </h2>


<h2> Results </h2>
<h5> My learnings</h5>

<p class="p1"> After I had talked to phootgraphers, done the survey and got the answers back I was advised by a mentor
   that I was going too broad on project's scope that I was more on a conceptual design path than UX design. I had
   to prioritize and remember that UX is as much about <b>technical possibilities</b> and <b>bussiness needs</b> as the
   user's needs.</p>
<p> So I narrowed down to the camera maker which is doing a better User Centered Design work (the one which
     have been working on most of the problems I've found on my research). I also filtered the answers towards what
     problems Fujifilm could improve on their models.</p>
<p> As a personal learning I realized that it is kind of easy for me to diverge and have new ideas but I gotta pay
     attention on the convergent stages because they are so important as having ideas. </p>
