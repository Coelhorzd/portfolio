<h2>Overview</h2>

<p class="p1">
<h5> The challenge </h5>
</p>
          <p>  This is a redesign exercise and I have selected WhatsApp because it's a widely used app in Brazil and I've always
            felt that its efficiency can be optimized. </p>
            <p class="p2"> So I'm going to focuss on Whatsapp for Android smartphones because Android is the most used mobile
              Operational System in Brazil. </p>

<h5> Length of project </h5>
<p class="p2">  I did this project alone in my freetime and it took me around 6 weeks. </p>

<h5>Process</h5>

<p class="p2"> The process will be described using the Design Thinking modes to show it in a more systematic way.
</p>

<br>

<p class="p1">
<h2>Empathizing</h2>
  </p>

<p class="p1">
<h5>User research</h5>
</p>

<p> I started gathering information by observing coworkers and teenager students using the product and also having informal 
          chats to get their honest opinions. </p>


<p class="p2"> There were around 10 participants on this stage.</p>

<br>

  <h2>Defining</h2>
  <p> (pain points, problems, proto personas) </p>


<p class="p1">  First Discoveries: </p>

  <p> 1 - After some users were asked to perform a task (send a message to someone on Whatsapp, then send a message to someone else) it was observed that most android users tap twice on Android's 'back' button (one tap to hide the keyboard and another one to go back to chats list) instead of using WhatsApp's 'back' arrow on the top left corner.</p>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
<p class="p1">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/whatsapp-back.png" alt=""> </p>

    </div>

    <p class="p2">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> Android’s 'back' button on the bottom bar and WhatsApp back button</span> </p>

  <p class="p1"> 2- It was also observed that many users utilize their smartphones most of the time with one hand, so WhatsApp's 'back' arrow is not placed on a thumb accessible area. Using Android’s 'back' button twice was easier and faster. Even when they are using both hands while typing they still use double tap on Android's back button.</p>

<br>

  <p class="p2"> 3 - That made me think about people who are not allowed to use both hands (permanently or temporarily) and also remember that there are differences on thumb zones for right-handed and left-handed users.</p>


<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">
     <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/thumb zone.png" alt="">
  </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
   <span class="caption text-muted">"Thumb zone" is a term coined by Steven Hoober</span> </p>

   <p class="p1">  4 - Another user told me that he usually scrools up and down a lot, and it makes his eyes tired.</p>

<br>

  <p class="p2">  5 - One of the users pointed out that the app should be a bit cleaner.</p>

<br>

          <br>

 <h5>  Defining the problems </h5>

<p class="p1"> Pain points 1, 2 were translated as: </p>
          <h6> - More efficient navigation (less taps to alternate between chats, faster, simpler). </h6>
          
 <p class="p1"> Pain point 3 was translated as: </p>
         <h6>  - Accessibility for one hand users. </h6>

<p class="p1"> Pain points 4 and 5 were translated as: </p>
         <h6>  - Cleaner chat screen to increase readability and decrease eyes stress. </h6>
          
<br>
</div>

<br>

  <p class="p1"> As a results of those discoveries I created two proto personas so I could have in mind during ideation stage. </p>

<br>

<p class="p1">
 <div class="highlights">

 <br>

<h5>   Proto Personas </h5>

   <p class="p1"> 1- Tom is a 16 year old student who lives by the minimum effort law. So, life for his generation is basically always online. He talks to people from many parts of the globe. The easier and faster to find someone (or a chat) on the app and alternate between chats, the better! So he will be able to talk with more people with less effort and speding less time. </p>

   <p> 2 - Janet is 28 year old and married who lost her right arm on a car crash. Now she is learning how to use her left hand to do everything, including using her smartphone and WhatsApp on it. More accessibility for left-handed people is also a must.</p>

<br>

</div>
</p>


<br>

  <p class="p1">   <h2> Ideation </h2>  </p>
    <p> (wireframes) </p>


  <P class="p1"> One of the possible solutions would be to use IOS bottom bar menu, but that pattern isn’t completely thumb accessible for one hand users and the bar menu it's not visible on a chat screen. So that pattern would not fix the pain point number 1 because IOS "left to right swipe gesture" to close a chat returning to main screen is not available on Android's Whatsapp version. </P>

<br>

  <p class="p1">  <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/IOS-menu.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>


<P class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">IOS bottom bar menu.</span> </p>

<br>

  <div class="highlights">
            <br>

  <h6> Best solution for making the navigation more efficient (pain points number 1, 2, and 3) is:</h6>

  <p class="p1"> A thumb accessible side bar menu adaptable for left or right-handed users. </p>

            <br>

</div>

<br>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">
    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/thumb-over-wire.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Thumb zone picture over wireframes</span> </p>

<br>


<div class="highlights">

          <br>

   <h6> To increase readability and decrease eyes stress (pain points 4 and 5) there were some options to consider: </h6>

  <p class="p1">
      - Make the keyboard shorter;</p>

  <P> - Shrinking or moving elements from the top of message area (top bar with picture and name); </P>

  <p> - Shortening empty space by getting rid of chat bubbles and using simpler way to distinguish between sent and received 
    messages. (although that would requires removing wallpaper freedom to prevent future image-text contrast issues); </p>

  <p> - Removing white spaces between consecutive messages from the same user (different lines but no white space); </p>

  <P> - Showing/hiding date and time information wether: </P>

  <p> - Making a simpler way to show message status (sent, received, read);</p>

  <p>   1- On a “slide and hold” gesture (like Instagram) or </p>

  <P>   2- On tapping the specific message (like facebook messenger) </P>

<br>

</div>

<br>

  <p class="p1"> After considering the options above some of them were discarded for the sake of accessibility and readability. 
            Then after some iterations, the result was the following wireframes:

</p>

<p class="p1">
<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
<p>    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/frame-1-left.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Wireframes for left-handed users</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="p1">
<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
<p>    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/frame-1-right.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

</p>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Wireframes for right-handed users</span> </p>

 </p>

<p class="p1">  During the creation of those wireframes I started to ask myself: </p>

      <p class="p1">
           - What if the user could change between conversations without going back to chats list everytime? </p>
      <p>  - How could it be done? </p>
      <p>  - Maybe some gesture to change straight from one chat to another? </p>
      <p>  - How to create a gesture that doesn't conflict with showing/hiding information gesture and the other Whatsapp gestures on Android? </p>
      <p>  - What if it's just available to the unread messages? </p>
      <p class="p2">  - What if it's just available to the top 3 on the chats list? </p>

<br>

<div class="highlights">

          <br>

  <h6> Those questions led me to a insight for a new feature: </h6>
  <p class="p1"> A swipe gesture on the user name to alternate between the top 3 chats on the chats list.
  </p>

          <br>

</div>

<br>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">
      <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/frame-2.png" alt="">
  </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">New feature highlight</span>
    </p>

<br>


<p class="p1">
 <h5> Next steps </h5>
</p>
  <p> Because visuals was not my focus of the project and UI isn't in my strongest skills, I didn't go further. So the next steps
    should be about building an intereactive prototype (versions with and without the new feature) and perform user tests.</p>

<p class="p1">
 <h5> Future project</h5>
</p>
  <p> Another insight from the project was about senior users . That idea would go to a
    backlog of insights as a simplified Whatsapp interface with visual/audible cues for elders who aren't very familiar with
    technology yet. It Could be a great opportunity to practice digital inclusion and accessibilty.</p>
