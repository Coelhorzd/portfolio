<h4>Context</h4>

          <p class="p1">  This is a redesign exercise, therefore it's not a real work for Facebook to apply on Whatsapp. </p>
            <p> I selected WhatsApp because it's a widely used app in Brazil and I've always felt that its efficiency can be optimized so I'm going to focuss on Whatsapp for Android smartphones because Adnroid is the most used mobile Operational System in Brazil.
</p>

<p class=p2>  I did project alone in my freetime and it toke about 4 months.

  That being said,  let’s get to the process. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Process</h2>

<p> My process was similar to Design Thinking approach although in a more organic way but the process will be described using the Design Thinking modes to show it in a systematic way.
<p class="p2"> </p>


<h4>Empathizing</h4> <p class="p1">
  </p>

<h5>User research</h5>
<p> I started gathering information by observing friends and relatives using the product and also having informal chats about how they use it. </p>


<p class="p2"> There were around 10 participants on this stage.</p>



  <h4>Defining</h4>
  <p> (problems, pain points, challenges) </p>


<p class="p1">  First Discoveries were: </p>

  <p> 1 - It was observed that most android users (when they are in a conversation with keyboard on screen) tap twice on Android's 'back' button, one tap to hide the keyboard and another one to go to chats list. That happens every time they mean to change between chats”.</p>

<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto">
<p class="p1">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/whatsapp-back.png" alt=""> </p>

    </div>

    <p class="p2">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> Android’s 'back' button on the bottom bar and WhatsApp back button</span> </p>

  <p class="p1"> Users could use the WhatsApp's 'back' arrow on the top left corner. So I tested this assumption and the result was that they rarely use this path. </p>

<p> 2- It was also observed that many users utilize their smartphones most of the time with one hand, so WhatsApp's 'back' arrow is not placed on a thumb accessible area. Using Android’s 'back' button twice was easier and faster.</p>


  <p class="p2"> 3 - That made me think about people who are not allowed to use both hands (permanently or temporarily) and also remember that there are differences on thumb zones for right-handed and left-handed users.</p>


<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">
     <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/thumb zone.png" alt="">
  </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
   <span class="caption text-muted">"Thumb zone" is a term coined by Steven Hoober</span> </p>

   <p class="p1">  4 - Another user told me that he usually scrools up and down a lot, because screen can't show too many messages at the same time. When keyboard is on screen it's even worse.</p>


  <p class="p2"> I Understood that as “screen is not being optmized to primary function (show messages)”.</p>

  <p class="p2">  5 - One of the users pointed out that the app should be a bit cleaner.</p>


<div class="highlights">

<p class="p1">  <h5>  Pain points </h5> </p>

  <p>Points 1, 2 and 3 were translated as - More efficient navigation (less taps to alternate between chats, faster, simpler and more friendly to one hand users)</p>

  <p> Points 4 and 5 were translated as - Cleaner chat screen to increase readability and decrease scrolling.</p>
</div>


  <p class="p1"> As a results of those discoveries I could come up with simplified persona profiles (which, I admit, were created only in my head for the ideation stage). </p>

<p class="p1">
 <div class="highlights">


<h5>   Personas </h5>

   <p class="p1"> 1- Tom is a 16 year old student who lives by the minimum effort law. So, life for his generation is basically always online. He talks to people from many parts of the globe. The easier and faster to find someone (or a chat) on the app and alternate between chats, the better! So, if he can optimizes his clicks/taps he will be able to talk with more people with less effort. </p>

   <p> 2 - Janet is 28 year old and married who lost her right arm on a car crash. Now she just has the left hand to do everything, including using her smartphone and WhatsApp on it. More accessibility for lefthanded people is also a must.</p>
 </div>
</p>




  <p class="p1">   <h4>Ideation and prototyping </h4>  </p>
    <p> (wireframes) </p>


  <P class="p1"> One of the possible solutions was to use IOS bottom bar menu, but that pattern isn’t completely thumb accessible for one hand users. Besides, the menu isn’t visible on chat screen, so it doesn't fix the pain point number 1. </P>


<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">  <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/IOS-menu.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>


<P class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">IOS bottom bar menu. Not visible on a chat screen</span> </p>


  <div class="highlights">
  <P class="p1"> A side bar menu could be a good fit for both left or right-handed users and also be thumb accessible. Solving points number 1, 2, and 3. </P>
</div>


<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">
    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/thumb-over-wire.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Thumb zone picture over wireframes</span> </p>


<div class="highlights">
  <p class="p1"> To satisfy users about points 4 and 5 there were some options:</P>

  <p class="p1">
      - Make the keyboard shorter;</p>

  <P> - Shrinking or moving elements from the top of message area (top bar with picture and name); </P>

  <p> - Shortening empty space by getting rid of chat bubbles and using simpler way to distinguish between sent and received messages. (although that would requires removing wallpaper freedom to prevent future image-text contrast issues); </p>

  <p> - Removing white spaces between consecutive messages from the same user (different lines but no white space); </p>

  <P> - Showing/hiding date and time information wether: </P>
  <p>   1- On a “slide and hold” gesture (like Instagram) or </p>
  <P>   2- On tapping the specific message (like facebook messenger) </P>
</div>

  <p class="p1"> The result after some iterations were the following wireframes:
  
</p>

<p class="p1">
<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto">
<p>    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/frame-1-left.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Wireframes for left-handed users</span> </p>

<p class="p1">
<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto">
<p>    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/frame-1-right.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

</p>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Wireframes for right-handed users</span> </p>
  
 </p>

<p class="p1">  When those screens were being created I started to ask myself: </p>

      <p class="p1">
           - What if the user could change from one conversation to another without having to go back to chats list? </p>
      <p>  - How could it be done? </p>
      <p>  - Maybe some gesture to change straight from one chat to another? </p>
      <p>  - How to create a gesture that doesn't conflict with showing/hiding information gesture? </p>
      <p>  - What if it's just available to the unread messages? </p>
      <p class="p2">  - What if it's just available to the top 3 on the chats list? </p>


  <p class="p1"> That lead to a possible new feature, which is a swipe gesture on the user name to alternate between top 3 chats on the chats lists.
  </p>

  <h4> Testing </h4>

  <p class="p1"> For the user testing a prototype (created on FIGMA) was shown to some friends and I asked what they think about it, what changes they could see upfront, How they feel about this interface, etc. But this prototype will not be shown this case study because I meant to focuss on UX design process.</P>

  <p> After they answered and gave me their impressions I explained what were the changes and what they meant to improve. (Although Most of them guessed it before I explained).</p>

  <p class="p1">There were between 5 and 9 participants on this stage. </p>



<p class="p1">
  <h5> Feedback </h5>
  </p>

  <p> One of the users who answered even before I explained the changes said:</P>


          <p class="p1">  <blockquote>“I think that this is more dinamic, less poluted and it makes a better use of the screen space”</blockquote> </p>


<p class="p1">  Other users told me that the new design “looks cool”, “it looks clean”, “it seems to be a good idea” and also.. </p>

          <p class="p1"> <blockquote>“It’s innovative and I think it will be well received” </blockquote> </p>



  <h2 class="section-heading"> Conclusion and next steps</h2>


  <p class="p1"> Based on users opinions, I think that the proposed changes would bring some efficiency and effectiveness to the use of this product.</p>



  <p> Another fact worth mentioning is that during the process there was an insight about senior users. That idea would go to a backlog of insights as a simplified Whatsapp version with visual/audible cues for elders who aren't very familiar with technology yet.</p>

  <p> It Could be a great opportunity to practice inclusion and accessibilty in digital products.</p>


  <p class="p2"> Finally I am aware that those are extreme changes to make in one update. They should be well planned and come in small increments and probably they would be improved and changed as they small updates get to users.</p>
