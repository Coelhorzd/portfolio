<h2>Overview</h2>

<p class="p1">
<h5> The challenge </h5>
</p>
          <p>  This is a redesign exercise, therefore it's not for Facebook to apply on Whatsapp. </p>
            <p> I selected WhatsApp because it's a widely used app in Brazil and I've always felt that its efficiency can be optimized. </p>
            <p class="p2"> so I'm going to focuss on Whatsapp for Android smartphones because Android is the most used mobile Operational System in Brazil. </p>

<h5> Length of project </h5>
<p class=p2>  I did this project alone in my freetime and it took me around 12 weeks. </p>

<h5>Process</h5>

<p class-"p2"> The process will be described using the Design Thinking modes to show it in a more systematic way.
</p>

<br>

<p class="p1">
<h2>Empathizing</h2>
  </p>

<p class="p1">
<h5>User research</h5>
</p>

<p> I started gathering information by observing coworkers and teenager students using the product and also having informal chats (without informing them about my project) so they would give me their honest opinions. </p>


<p class="p2"> There were around 10 participants on this stage.</p>

<br>

  <h2>Defining</h2>
  <p> (pain points, problems, proto personas) </p>


<p class="p1">  First Discoveries: </p>

  <p> 1 - After some users were asked to perform a task (send a message to someone on Whatsapp, then send a message to someone else) it was observed that most android users tap twice on Android's 'back' button (one tap to hide the keyboard and another one to go back to chats list) instead of using WhatsApp's 'back' arrow on the top left corner.</p>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
<p class="p1">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/whatsapp-back.png" alt=""> </p>

    </div>

    <p class="p2">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> Android’s 'back' button on the bottom bar and WhatsApp back button</span> </p>

  <p class="p1"> 2- It was also observed that many users utilize their smartphones most of the time with one hand, so WhatsApp's 'back' arrow is not placed on a thumb accessible area. Using Android’s 'back' button twice was easier and faster. Even when they are using both hands while typing they still use double tap on Android's back button.</p>

<br>

  <p class="p2"> 3 - That made me think about people who are not allowed to use both hands (permanently or temporarily) and also remember that there are differences on thumb zones for right-handed and left-handed users.</p>


<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">
     <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/thumb zone.png" alt="">
  </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
   <span class="caption text-muted">"Thumb zone" is a term coined by Steven Hoober</span> </p>

   <p class="p1">  4 - Another user told me that he usually scrools up and down a lot, and it makes his eyes tired.</p>

<br>

  <p class="p2">  5 - One of the users pointed out that the app should be a bit cleaner.</p>

<br>

<div class="highlights">
          <br>

 <h5>  Defining the problems </h5>

<p class="p1"> Pain points 1, 2 and 3 were translated as: </p>
          <h6> - More efficient navigation (less taps to alternate between chats, faster, simpler and more friendly to one hand users). </h6>

<p class="p1"> Pain points 4 and 5 were translated as: </p>
         <h6>  - Cleaner chat screen to increase readability and decrease eyes stress. </h6>
<br>
</div>

<br>

  <p class="p1"> As a results of those discoveries I created two proto personas so I could have in mind during ideation stage. </p>

<br>

<p class="p1">
 <div class="highlights">

 <br>

<h5>   Proto Personas </h5>

   <p class="p1"> 1- Tom is a 16 year old student who lives by the minimum effort law. So, life for his generation is basically always online. He talks to people from many parts of the globe. The easier and faster to find someone (or a chat) on the app and alternate between chats, the better! So he will be able to talk with more people with less effort and speding less time. </p>

   <p> 2 - Janet is 28 year old and married who lost her right arm on a car crash. Now she is learning how to use her left hand to do everything, including using her smartphone and WhatsApp on it. More accessibility for left-handed people is also a must.</p>

<br>

</div>
</p>


<br>

  <p class="p1">   <h2> Ideation and prototyping </h2>  </p>
    <p> (wireframes, mockups) </p>


  <P class="p1"> One of the possible solutions would be to use IOS bottom bar menu, but that pattern isn’t completely thumb accessible for one hand users and the bar menu it's not visible on a chat screen. So that pattern would not fix the pain point number 1 because IOS "left to right swipe gesture" to close a chat returning to main screen is not available on Android's Whatsapp version. </P>

<br>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">  <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/whatsapp/IOS-menu.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>


<P class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">IOS bottom bar menu.</span> </p>

<br>

  <div class="highlights">
            <br>

  <p> A side bar menu could be a good fit for both left or right-handed users and also be thumb accessible. Making the navigation more efficient (pain points number 1, 2, and 3). </p>

            <br>

</div>

<br>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
  <p class="p1">
    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/thumb-over-wire.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Thumb zone picture over wireframes</span> </p>

<br>


<div class="highlights">

          <br>

   To increase readability and decrease eyes stress (pain points 4 and 5) there were some options to consider:

  <p class="p1">
      - Make the keyboard shorter;</p>

  <P> - Shrinking or moving elements from the top of message area (top bar with picture and name); </P>

  <p> - Shortening empty space by getting rid of chat bubbles and using simpler way to distinguish between sent and received messages. (although that would requires removing wallpaper freedom to prevent future image-text contrast issues); </p>

  <p> - Removing white spaces between consecutive messages from the same user (different lines but no white space); </p>

  <P> - Showing/hiding date and time information wether: </P>

  <p> - Making a simpler way to show message status (sent, received, read);</p>

  <p>   1- On a “slide and hold” gesture (like Instagram) or </p>

  <P>   2- On tapping the specific message (like facebook messenger) </P>

<br>

</div>

<br>

  <p class="p1"> After considering accessibility of the options above, and after some iterations, the result was the following wireframes:

</p>

<p class="p1">
<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
<p>    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/frame-1-left.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Wireframes for left-handed users</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="p1">
<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
<p>    <img class="img-fluid" src=" /renancoelho/img/whatsapp/frame-1-right.png" alt=""> </p>
</div>

</p>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Wireframes for right-handed users</span> </p>

 </p>

<p class="p1">  During the creation of those wireframes I started to ask myself: </p>

      <p class="p1">
           - What if the user could change between conversations without going back to chats list everytime? </p>
      <p>  - How could it be done? </p>
      <p>  - Maybe some gesture to change straight from one chat to another? </p>
      <p>  - How to create a gesture that doesn't conflict with showing/hiding information gesture and the other Whatsapp gestures on Android? </p>
      <p>  - What if it's just available to the unread messages? </p>
      <p class="p2">  - What if it's just available to the top 3 on the chats list? </p>

<br>

<div class="highlights">

          <br>

  <h6> That lead to a possible new feature, which is a swipe gesture on the user name to alternate between the top 3 chats on the chats list.
  </h6>

          <br>

</div>

<br>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">

  </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted">New feature highlight</span>
    </p>

<br>


<p class="p1">
 <h5> Next steps </h5>
</p>
  <p> Because visuals was not my focus of the project and UI isn't in my strongest skills, I didn't go further so the next steps 
    should be build an intereactive prototype to perform user tests.</p>

<p class="p1">
 <h5> Insight for future </h5>
</p>
  <p> Another fact worth mentioning is that during the process there was an insight about senior users. That idea would go to a
    backlog of insights as a simplified Whatsapp version with visual/audible cues for elders who aren't very familiar with
    technology yet. It Could be a great opportunity to practice digital inclusion and accessibilty.</p>
