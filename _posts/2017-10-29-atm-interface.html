<h4>Context</h4>

          <p class="p1">  The interest of working on this project was first triggered by observing people in lines at banks, as the most used ATM machines in Brazil are at banks. Once I went to the bank and I had noticed that people are usually bored about coming to the bank to use the ATM, just like me. So I decided to make something to try to improve the ATM user experience. This study case happens in Brazil so some points may only make sense for user experience at the ATM machines of brazilian banks. </p>
<p> A secondary goal was to exercise my design skills and I did this project alone. </p>

<p class="p2"> Design Thinking was the chosen approach.</p>


<h4>Empathizing</h4>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1">On the first stage of research was about observation and informal talks with realtives and friends.
After that a survey was created and shared with some coworkers and friends. </p>

<p> There were 7 on this stage. </p>
