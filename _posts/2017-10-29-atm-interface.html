<h2>Overview</h2>

<p class="p1">
<h5> The challenge </h5>
</p>

<p>  This UX design exercise was chosen after I observed people in lines at banks. </p>
<p> Most used ATM machines in Brazil are at banks but even many people started to use the bank app lately, we still have
to use the ATM for some purposes. So it's a great opportunity of project and try to improve ATM users experience. </p>
<p class="p2"> This study case happens in Brazil so perhaps some points may only make sense for user experience at the ATM machines of brazilian
  banks. </p>

  <h5> Length of project </h5>
  <p class="p2">  I did this project alone in my freetime and it took me around 3 months. </p>

  <h5>Process</h5>

<p class="p2"> Double diamond method was used on this project development.</p>

<br>

<h4>Discovering</h4>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1">On the first stage of research I interviewed some coworkers and relatives.
After that a survey was created to be shared and test some assumptions aswell to get some insights. </p>

<p> There were 6 participants on this stage. </p>

<h4>Defining</h4>

<p> (pain points, problems) </p>

<p class="p1">  The survey showed that every user goes to an ATM to withdraw and make a deposit, few users also transfer money,
  deal with loans details and get the validation to use their smartphones to use the app.</p>

  <p> Some users would like to be able to update personal information which. For while, they have to talk to someone inside the
    bank to get it done. </p>

  <p class="p2"> But the most interesting point is: To accomplish what you want when you go to the ATM, everyone still takes a
    lot of time. People loose time waiting on the line, people wait for the machine to recongnize they card, they wait for the
    machine to verify their password or biometrics, and they wait for the machine to deliver the money. </p>
