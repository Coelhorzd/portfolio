<h2>Overview</h2>

<br>

<h5> The challenge </h5>

<p>  This UX design exercise was chosen after I observed people in a queue waiting to use an ATM machine. </p>
<p> Most used ATMs in Brazil are in the banks, but even that nowadays many people use their bank app we still have
to use the ATM for some tasks. So it's a great opportunity for a project trying to improve ATM users experience. </p>
<p class="p2"> This study case happens in Brazil so perhaps some points may only make sense for user experience at the ATM
  machines of brazilian banks. </p>


  <h5> My role and length of project </h5>
  <p class="p2"> I have done project on my own and it took me about 5 months. </p>

  <h5>Process</h5>

<p class="p2"> Double diamond method was used on this project development.</p>

<br>

<h2>Discovering</h2>
<br>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p>On the first stage of research I interviewed some coworkers and relatives.
After that a survey was created to be shared and test some assumptions, and also to understand better the current state. </p>

<p> The survey was answered by 8 participants. </p>
<br>

</p>


<br>


<h2>Defining</h2>


 <p class="p1"> An affinity mapping was created with the answers gathered from the survey</p>

          <br>
  
          <h6> Design problems </h6>

<p class="p1"> - Withdrawing and deposit are the most frequent tasks at ATMs; </p>

<p> - Users would like to do as much as possible on the app, but some functions still need them to go to an ATM or even inside
  the bank to talk to someone, like update personal information, deal with loan details, limit adjsutments etc;</p>

  <p class="p2"> - Losing time is still a big deal for ATMs. People wait on the line, wait for the machine to recongnize
  their card, wait for the machine to verify their password or biometrics and they wait for the machine to select and
  deliver the money.</p>
  
  <br>
</div>

<br>

<h2> Ideation</h2>

<br>

<H5> HOW MIGHT WE... </H5>

<p class="p1"> ...<h6> shorten the waiting time? </h6> </p>

<p class="p1"> ...<h6> simplify the access to the most used
  options but don't forget the less used ones (hidden under many menu levels)?</h6> </p>

<br>

<div class="highlights">
          <br>
  
<H6> Solution </H6>
  
<p class="p1"> As the most frequent tasks aren't numerous we can start by bringing them to the home screen. </p>

<p> But as we can't let the used tasks more difficult to find we could make use of a search bar. The users can search
  for the ke words which will show them options related to the key word.</p>

<p> For the many waiting moments during the journey, the ATM could run the authentications on the background while the user
  may advance some steps in their tasks instead of waiting for the machine to allow them to go further.</p>

  <p> So the result after some iterations and adjustments is:</p>
  
  <br>
  
<p> - A simple interface with the most used services + a search bar to find the less used ones in an easier and faster way.
    Yet some buttons for each main service category are visible for those itens which are used from time to time; </p>
  
<br>
  
<p> - Regarding time efficiency the interface runs the authentications on second plan while the user would not wait to proceed
    the necessary steps of the desired task. </p>

  <br>
  </div>
  <br>
<br>

<h2> Prototyping</h2>
<br>

<h5> wireframes </h5>

<p> The user insert his card but the most used options are already available to get going even before card authentication is complete.  </p>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
    <p class="p1">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/atm-home.png" alt="">
    </p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted"> ATM home screen wireframe</span>
</p>
<br>


<p> This way a user could, for example, insert the card and choose the withdrawing option.   </p>

  <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
      <p class="p1">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/atm-home2.png" alt="">
      </p>
  </div>

  <p class="p2">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> ATM home screen</span>
  </p>
<br>



<p> Fill the amount of money he wants to withdraw and chose which set of bills he would preffer
  <b>while</b> the ATM is checking his card, account and balance information.</p>

<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
    <p class="p1">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/atm-withdraw1.png" alt="">
    </p>
</div>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted"> Filling the amount field </span>
</p>


<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
    <p class="p1">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/atm-withdraw2.png" alt="">
    </p>
</div>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="caption text-muted"> Choosing the bills set </span>
</p>
<br>

<p> Now he can Retrieve his card, then fills the pin code field (or uses biometrics sensor), <b>while</b> the
  machine is getting his set of bills ready to deliver, so just after confirmation he already gets the money and goes.</p>

  <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
      <p class="p1">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/atm-withdraw3.png" alt="">
      </p>
  </div>
  <p class="p2">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> Retrieving card and entering biometric validation </span>
  </p>


    <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <p class="p1">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/atm-withdraw4.png" alt="">
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="p2">
      <span class="caption text-muted"> Finishing the transation or keep using the ATM </span>
    </p>
