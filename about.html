<p class="p1"> Since I was 10 years old I had dreamed about to become an INVENTOR. I wanted to IMPROVE AND CREATE things that 
          people use everyday so THEIR LIVES would be BETTER (and maybe I would get rich on the process. why not?). But I ended up 
          with a BSc in chemistry.</p>

        <p class="p1"> In my last year at college there was a serious fire accident in a night club in Brazil and I kept 
                  wondering: </p>
<br>
<span class="caption text-muted"> “ WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE CREATE A BETTER FIRE EXTINGUISHER YET? HOW OLD IS CURRENT DESIGN?” </span>
<br>

<p class="p1"> I kept thinking so I decided to approach the problem with a method. I started from what makes a fire in order to 
          understand how I could put an end to it. So I found some ways but I picked the safest and less complicated one. But I had 
          to finish my studies so I put my notes aside for a while. </p>
                  
         <p class="p1"> At some point I found out that some guys in Indonesia have had a similar idea couple years before and they 
                   already had a product called Elide fire ball so I moved on.</p>

        <p class="p1"> Some months ago I heard about UX design and started to study about it. Now here I am looking for an 
                  opportunity to help change the world. </p>
<br>
<p> After all, <b> WHO IS RENAN? </b> </p>
<br>

<p class="p1"> - A chemist who have 
          always been a designer and sometimes an inventor. Despite that I'm also a simple guy who enjoys photography (mostly landscape 
          and street photography), playing basketball and table-tennis, watching sports, science fiction and documentaries, learning 
          about other languages, culture and investiments. I also love traveling and reading about the lastests technologies.</p>
