<p class="p1"> I had dreamed about to become an INVENTOR since I was 8 or 9 years old. I wanted to IMPROVE AND CREATE things that
          people use everyday so THEIR LIVES would be BETTER (and maybe I would get rich on the process. why not?). But I ended up
          with a BSc in chemistry.</p>

              </div>

              <p class="p2">
              <span class="caption text-muted"> Chemistry experiment.</span> </p>

<br>

        <p> In my last year at college there was a serious fire accident in a night club in Brazil, I was not
          there but I kept wondering: </p>
<br>
          <h5 style="text-align:center"> “ WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE CREATE A BETTER FIRE EXTINGUISHER YET? ”  </h5>
<br>
          <h5 style="text-align:center">  “ HOW OLD IS CURRENT DESIGN? ” </h5>
<br>

<p> I started from what makes a fire in order to understand how I could come up with a way to put an end to it.
          I found few ways but I picked the safest and less complicated one.</p>
  <p> During those days I had to finish my studies so I put my messy notes/sketches aside for a while. </p>

          <br>
                    <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto">
                    <p class="p1">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/renancoelho/img/drawing-pic.png" alt=""> </p>

                        </div>

                        <p class="p2">
                        <span class="caption text-muted"> Fire extinguisher raw sketches.</span> </p>

          <br>

         <p> At some point I found out that some guys in Indonesia had a similar idea couple years before and they
                   already had a product called Elide fire ball so I moved on from that project.</p>

        <p> Around mid 2019 I heard about UX design and started to study about it. Now here I am looking for an
                  opportunity to help improving things. </p>
