<p class="p1"> Since I was 10 years old I had dreamed about to become an INVENTOR. I wanted to IMPROVE AND CREATE things that
          people use everyday so THEIR LIVES would be BETTER (and maybe I would get rich on the process. why not?). But I ended up
          with a BSc in chemistry.</p>

              <p class="p2">
              <span class="caption text-muted"> Chemistry PH experiment.</span> </p>

        <p class="p1"> In my last year at college there was a serious fire accident in a night club in Brazil, I was not
          there but I kept wondering: </p>
<br>
<span class="caption text-muted"> “ WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE CREATE A BETTER FIRE EXTINGUISHER YET? ”  </span>
<br>
<span class="caption text-muted">  “ HOW OLD IS CURRENT DESIGN? ” </span>
<br>

<p class="p1"> I kept thinking so I decided to approach the problem with a method. I started from what makes a fire in
  order to understand how I could come up with a way to put an end to it. So I found some ways but I picked the safest
  and less complicated one.</p>
  <p> During those days I had to finish my studies so I put my notes aside for a while. </p>

         <p class="p1"> At some point I found out that some guys in Indonesia have had a similar idea couple years before and they
                   already had a product called Elide fire ball so I moved on from that project.</p>

        <p class="p1"> Around mid 2019 I heard about UX design and started to study about it. Now here I am looking for an
                  opportunity to help change the world. </p>
