<p class="p1"> The story starts when I was 10 years old, since this age my dream was to become an INVENTOR. I wanted to IMPROVE AND CREATE things that 
          people use everyday so THEIR LIVES would be BETTER (and maybe I would get rich on the process. why not?). But
          I could not move to another city to study mechanical engineering or industrial design so I got a BSc in chemistry.</p>

        <p class="p1"> When I was about to finish college there was a serious fire accident in a night club in Brazil and I kept 
          wondering “ WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE CREATE A BETTER FIRE EXTINGUISHER YET? HOW OLD IS CURRENT DESIGN?” Then I had an idea (my own
           method for idea generation was similar to SCAMPER), I took some notes and kept doing my research while I also had to finish 
                  my studies. </p>
                  
         <p class="p1"> At some point I found out that some guys in Indonesia have had a similar idea and they already had a product called Elide
           fire ball. So I saved my notes and moved on.</p>

        <p class="p1"> Some months ago I got to know about UX design and I got really interested on it  because it impacts society 
                  as much as design of physical products. I have started to study about it and here I am looking for an opportunity to 
                  help changing the world. </p>
