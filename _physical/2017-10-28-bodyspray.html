  <h2> Context </h2>

   <p>This project came up from questioning the current can design and business model of body sprays after some bad experiences I had myself. I didn't use design thinking approach, because I didn't know anything about it back then, but I can say now that intuitively the development of this project had most design thinking modes.</p>

<p class="p1"> <h2> Process </h2> </p>

<p> <h5> Competitors analysis (current business model) </h5> </p>

<p>  <h4> User Journey and product life cycle (criar***) </h4> </p>



<p> Every company which makes body sprays do it in a similar way, they get aluminum/steel cans from factories, fill it with propellant and their formula (including fragrance and other substances), distribute to supermarkets, drugstores etc. Those cans may be recycled or not (it depends on city, state and country policy), but considering those which were recycled, they go from homes to recycling sites and from there back to factories, restarting the cycle.</p>

<p class="p1"> So let's get to the Pros and Cons:</p>

<p> CONS </p>

<p> - Users buy a new can eveytime (users pay for a making/recycling all those bottles);</p>
<p> - The cans may or not be recycled (lots of them aren’t); </p>
<p> - Lots of fuel spent in transportation (and users pay for it) because the </p>
<p> volume and weight is large (cans in boxes from factory to many different cities); </p>
<p> - Polution into the atmosphere from the several transportation phases (from factory to store, from users to collecting points, from collecting to recycling sites, from recycling to the factories and from there to stores again). </p>
<p> - Use of petro based propellant (butane, propane gas) (which aren’t ecofriendly, nor a renewable source); </p>

<p> PROS </p>

<p> - Easy to use, buy and go </p>

<p>  <h4> Defining challenges (points to improve) </h4> </p>

<p> From the many Cons points we can assume some user problems and some business problems: </p>

<p> - Cost is high for business and users; </p>
<p> - It's dependent of non renewable sources (like petro based propellant) also not good for business and environment, neither for users health and safety; </p>
<p> - It consumes lots of fuel on transportation which is neither good for business and environment; </p>
<p> - No freedom of choises when talking about bottle size. They are usually "standard" size only; </p>
<p> - That one size only may be a problem to carry on trips (most cas are above the maximum allowed volume in airplanes); </p>
<p> - Also because they contain flamable propellant they aren't ideal to carry on flights. </p>

<p> <h4> Ideation </h4> </p>

<p> The best solution to fulfill those requirements is: </p>

<p> - To work with such machine the bottles are reusable and rechargeable. Users/consumers buy the bottles and bring them to the selling point to recharge when they need; </p>
<p> - The users/consumers have freedom to buy a range of values (from 1 Dolar/Euro/Real/Pound up to the maximum capacity of the can; </p>
<p> - There is more than one bottle size (a small one that would be allowed on planes, an average one which you can carry on short work trips or to the gym and a bigger one which would stay at home; </p>
<p> - Also, to be ecofriendly, safer and not being depedent on petro based propellants, the machines would have an internal air compressor to purge the previous fragrance and fill the cans with propellant (compressed air) + new chosen fragrance; </p>
<p> - "Is it compressed air good enough?" you might ask. The valve on the can bottom is compatible with some air pump models (such as a ball pump), so you can refill the can (at home) with more propellant (compressed air) if it runs out before the fragrance; </p>

<p> <h5> Prototypes </h5> </p>

<p> Here are some sketches and prototypes created to test the concept </p>
