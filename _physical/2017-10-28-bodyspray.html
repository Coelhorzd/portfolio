<h2> Context </h2>

<p>This project came up from questioning the current can design and business model of body sprays after some bad experiences
 I had myself. I didn't use design thinking approach, because I didn't know anything about it back then, but I can say now
 that intuitively the development of this project had most design thinking modes and I have always used (intuitively) the SCAMPER ideation method.</p>

<p class="p1"> <h2> Process </h2> </p>

<p> <h5> Competitors analysis (current business model) </h5> </p>

<p>  <h4> User Journey and product life cycle (criar***) </h4> </p>

<p> Every company which makes body sprays do it in a similar way, they get aluminum/steel cans from factories, fill it with
propellant and their formula (including fragrance and other substances), send them to supermarkets, drugstores etc. Those
cans may be recycled or not (it depends on city, state and country policy), but considering those which were recycled, they
go from homes to recycling sites and from there back to factories, restarting the cycle.</p>

<p> So the product life cycle is:</p>

<p> <span class="caption text-muted"> User/consumer journey </span> </p>


<p class="p1"> So let's check Pros and Cons of the current business model:</p>

<p> CONS </p>

<p> - Users buy a new can eveytime (users pay for a making/recycling and transportation of each bought bottle);</p>
<p> - Those cans may or not be recycled (lots of them aren’t); </p>
<p> - Lots of fuel is spent in transportation (and users pay for it) because the volume and weight is large (cans in boxes from
can factory to bodyspray factory and from there
to many different cities). Also fuel is spent on transportation from collecting points to recycling sites; </p>
<p> - Polution into the atmosphere from the several transportation phases; </p>
<p> - Use of petro based propellant (butane, propane gas) (which aren’t ecofriendly, nor a renewable source); </p>

<p> PROS </p>

<p> - Easy to use, buy and go; </p>
<p> - No need to remember about bringing the can to the selling point when you need to buy more bodyspray. </p>

<p>  <h4> Defining challenges (points to improve) </h4> </p>

<p> From the many Cons we can assume some user problems and some business problems: </p>

<p> - Cost is high for business and users; </p>
<p> - It's dependent of non renewable sources (like petro based propellant) also not good for business and environment, neither for
users health and safety; </p>
<p> - It consumes lots of fuel on transportation which is neither good for business and environment; </p>
<p> - No freedom of choise when talking about bottle size (you have to buy more than one can if you want more product).
They are usually "standard" size only; </p>
<p> - That one size only may be a problem to carry on trips (most cans are above the maximum allowed volume in airplanes); </p>
<p> - Also because they contain flamable propellant they aren't ideal to carry on flights. </p>

<p> <h4> Ideation </h4> </p>

<p> The best solution to fulfill those requirements is: </p>

<p> - Having reusable and rechargeable cans. Users/consumers buy the bottles and bring them to the selling point to recharge
when they need; </p>
<p> - That would require a vending machine on each selling point, where you can buy a recharge;
<p> - The users/consumers have freedom to buy a range of values (from 1 Dolar/Euro/Real/Pound up to the maximum capacity of the can; </p>
<p> - There is more than one bottle size (a small one that would be allowed on planes, an average one which you can carry on short
work trips or to the gym and a bigger one which would stay at home; </p>
<p> - Also, to be ecofriendly, safer and not being depedent on petro based propellants, those machines would have an internal air
compressor to purge the previous fragrance and fill the cans with propellant (compressed air) + new chosen fragrance; </p>
<p> - You might ask "Is it compressed air good enough?". The valve on the can bottom is compatible with some air pump models
(such as a ball pump), so you can refill the can (at home) with more propellant (compressed air) if it runs out before the
fragrance; </p>

<p> <h5> Prototypes </h5> </p>

<p> Here are some sketches and prototypes created to test the concept </p>
