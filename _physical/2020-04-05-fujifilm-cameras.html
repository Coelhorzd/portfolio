<h2>Overview</h2>

<br>

<h5> The challenge </h5>

<p>  Photographic cameras have always had a very similar design, even after they became digital (DSLR and more recently
   mirrorless) they still have similar looks and controls . </p>
<p> As an amateur photographer I’ve felt how difficult is to learn how to use a camera properly because it
has a lot of buttons and features. Most recent Fujifilm's cameras have an interesting experience but could it get even better?</p>

<br>

<h5> My role and length of project </h5>
<p class="p2"> I have done this redesign project on my own and it took me about 4 months. </p>


  <h5>Process</h5>

<p class="p2"> Double diamond method was used on this project development.</p>

<br>

<h2>Discovering</h2>

<h5>User research</h5>

<p class="p1">I talked to few photographers and I also created a survey based on some notes of a video (where two photographers
  were questioning current cameras designs) and some notes from the chats.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="p2">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> Mentioned video about current camera design</span>
  </p>

  <br>

  <p> The main points presented on the survey were: </p>

  <p class="p1"> 1 - Quicker and more intuitive way to change Aperture, ISO and shutter speed; </p>
  <p> 2 - Modes A, S, M aren’t most adequate. Let’s say you want to adjust Aperture and ISO, or shutter speed and aperture but
    you do not want a full manual mode;</p>
  <p> 3 - Dedicated White balance and Tint control with fast access;</p>
  <p> 4 - Shoot modes (single shot, burst), maybe a pressure sensor to change FPS while shooting;</p>
  <p> 5 - Easier and quicker way to move the focus point on screen;</p>
  <p> 6 - Easier an quicker way to zoom in and out on preview mode;</p>
  <p> 7 - Being able to save settings for photo or video and alternate between them quickly;</p>
  <p> 8 - When looking through the viewfinder (on mirrorless cameras), you should be able to see how the picture is exposed or
    without taking it into account;</p>
  <p> 9 - All (or most) buttons and adjusts accessible for the right hand, leaving the left hand with only one job (hold the
    camera);</p>
  <p> 10 -Screen - better quality, bigger and more responsible touch screen; </p>
  <p> 11 - Battery door on the side and not on the bottom;</p>
  <p> 12 - Better strap conection and easy lock/unlock system so you can exchange them easily and fast;</p>
  <p> 13 - Proper eyepiece locking system, to prevent losing it;</p>
<p class="p2">  14 - Improving camera ergonomics;</p>

<br>

<p> 7 photographers answered the survey. </p>

<h5> My learnings</h5>

<p class="p1"> At some point I've noticed that I was going too broad on project's scope that I was more on a conceptual industrial
   design path than UX design. I had to prioritize and remember that UX is as much about <b>technical possibilities</b> and <b>bussiness
     needs</b> as the user's needs.</p>
   <p> So I've realized that it is kind of easy for me to diverge and have new ideas but I gotta pay attention on the convergent
     stages because they are so important as having ideas. </p>

-----------------------------------------------



        As an amateur photographer I’ve felt how difficult is to learn how to use DSLR or Mirrorless cameras properly because it
        has a lot of buttons and features which you should use with your eye on the viewfinder. After wondering about cameras
        design and usability I’ve decided to start this redesign exercise.

        I did this project on my own and it toke me about 2 months.
----

        I have started making some assumptions which I would later test with users but then I found a video of two professional
        photographers on youtube and they were questioning the current design of digital cameras.

I used the points discussed on the video to create a survey and also as the base for chats with photographers I would have online.

----
User research

I got ## answers on the survey and I talked to ## photographers.

The main points taken from the video and presented on the survey were:

 1 - Quicker and more intuitive way to change Aperture, ISO and shutter speed;
 2 - Modes A, S, M aren’t most adequate. Let’s say you want to adjust Aperture and ISO, or shutter speed and aperture but you do
 not want a full manual mode;
 3 - Dedicated White balance and Tint control with fast access;
 4 - Shoot modes (single shot, burst), maybe a pressure sensor to change FPS while shooting;
 5 - Easier and quicker way to move the focus point on screen;
 6 - Easier an quicker way to zoom in and out on preview mode;
 7 - Being able to save settings for photo or video and alternate between them quickly;
 8 - When looking through the viewfinder (on mirrorless cameras), you should be able to see how the picture is exposed or without
 taking it into account;
 9 - All (or most) buttons and adjusts accessible for the right hand, leaving the left hand with only one job (hold the camera);
10 -Screen - better quality, bigger and more responsible touch screen;
11 - Battery door on the side and not on the bottom;
12 - Better strap conection and easy lock/unlock system so you can exchange them easily and fast;
13 - Proper eyepiece locking system, to prevent losing it;
14 - Improving camera ergonomics;
